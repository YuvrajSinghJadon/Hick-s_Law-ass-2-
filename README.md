What is Hick’s law ? 

Hick's law is a psychological principle that states that the time it takes for a person to make a decision increases with the number of options or choices available. This means that as the number of choices or stimuli increases, the decision-making time also increases. The law is often applied in fields such as interface design, marketing, and ergonomics to optimise the number of options presented to people for faster and more efficient decision-making.

Hick's law does not have a specific mathematical formula, but it can be expressed as a logarithmic function:

					RT = a + b log2(N)

where RT is the reaction time to a stimulus, N is the number of possible stimuli, and a and b are constants that depend on the particular situation and individual. The formula suggests that as the number of stimuli increases, the reaction time will increase logarithmically. However, it is important to note that the exact form and applicability of the formula may vary depending on the experimental setup and other factors.1.This is the first and the simplest menu, where the user does not have many choices and thus can make his/her choice faster.
Here the response time to click the buy-now button was:
RT = 5.5 s

This is the second menu and this one is slightly more complex then the first one as here first the user has to choose between the what category of product they have to buy and then make further choices,
To decide what product to buy.
Here as we can see the reaction time to finally clicking on the BUY-NOW Button was :
RT = 8.79 s

This is the third menu and this is the most complex of them all and here we can see the user has to make the most number of choices , like they have to first decide they have to go with weather they have to buy according to category or by brand.
Then they have to decide what kind of product  to buy and and they will finally make choice that what product they will buy.
Here as we can see the response time to finally click on the BUY-NOW button was :
RT = 17.38 s ! 
Which is way more then the first two.


**Conclusion:**

The more choices we have the more time we take to decide and take a decision this is what the HICK’s law states. And here we can clearly see the that the first two menus are rather simple and the user does not have many choices whereas in the third one he has to make a number of choices and this can is clearly visible by the reaction times.
